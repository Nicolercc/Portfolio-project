          Hi there,
          <br />

          I am Nicole Rodriguez, a passionate software engineering fellow at
          Pursuit. This is my first creative project and I had a lot of fun
          developing it. My goal with this project is to bring some joy and
          laughter to people's lives. As a developer, I believe that technology
          should not only solve problems but also make people smile. I hope you
          enjoy using my joke generator as much as I enjoyed building it!
